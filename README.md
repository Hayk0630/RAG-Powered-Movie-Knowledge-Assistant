# RAG-Powered Movie Knowledge Assistant

This project implements a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) enhanced model** using **LangChain** and **Hugging Face**. The model can answer questions about movies by using the **movie script or book** as its knowledge source.

## Features
- Answer questions about movies based on script or book content
- Built with **LangChain** and **Hugging Face**
- Easy to use: only a Jupyter notebook is provided, no additional setup required

## Usage
1. Open the provided notebook.
2. Load your movie script or book.
3. Ask questions about the content and get answers generated by the model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- `transformers`
- `langchain`
- `torch`
- `datasets` (optional, if you want to add more data)

## Notes
- This is a lightweight, notebook-based implementation designed for ease of use.
- You can extend it by adding more scripts or books for richer answers.
